# 🤝 How to contribute ?
Hey 👋 cool that you stopped by! Here you can find any information about how you can contribute to the project, we are always looking for your help! We think there are two scenarios right now: Either you have already an idea what to code or you just want to participate in the project. Go and checkout the specific section:

## 💡 I have a new awesome fancy idea!
That is great! Please check our open issues if a similar already exists. Feel free to add your ideas to this issue, and we will discuss how we can improve this. If no similar issue exists, please _not open a new issue_! Instead, head over to [discussions](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/discussions) and start a new discussion with the category "Ideas 💡".

Then we will talk about how your idea fits into the project, what must be considered and what will be the scope of a corresponding User Story. Afterwards, the core team will create a new User Story issue. Meanwhile, you can check out the [development section of README](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot#%EF%B8%8F-development) and prepare your local dev-environment. After the User Story has been created, go and checkout the next section!

## 🛠️ I just want to help!
Cool! Every kind of contribution is very welcome! To find open user stories, head over to the [issues tab](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/issues) and pick a task you want to do. The term user story comes from the Agile software development world, you can find many about this on the internet with the search engine of your choice.

> ⚠️ Please note: Stay in scope of the user story! Do not commit changes that are not requests. If you think, something can be improved -> That is a new user story. But of cause you can fix any typos, comments etc. if this helps in terms of code readability! 

Write a comment and tell us, that you will working on it. Afterwards, yeah!, you are ready to go! Continue with the next section...


## 🌳 The branching strategy!
To have a better overview and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

1. Your branch should be based on the `main` branch.
2. `main` requires a linear history. Make sure that your branch is based on the head of `main` before you make a PR. _Rebase_ if needed. Do not merge the `main` into your dev branch.
3. Name your dev-branch based on your user story like `tjarbo/102-Fix-moodle-exception-errors` (`[username]/[issue-number]-Title`) and not just `bugfix-1`

Okay, that's it! Happy Coding 🎉
