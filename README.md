The FMDB notifies you on a discord server about new activities on the Moodle platform. The current implementation includes:

- Notification of new or changed files
- Notification of new assignments
- Notification of assignments due soon

## ‚úàÔ∏è Get started

The set-up is a somewhat more complex process. Therefore we have created a separate Wiki article for this purpose. You can find it [here](#).
> ‚ö†Ô∏è According to the current status, the article could unfortunately not yet be created.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites ‚öóÔ∏è

- Local MongoDB installation on port 27017 (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
- Node with NPM is installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Installing modules üìÅ

Run `npm i` at the root of the repository and `npm run postinstall`

#### Create .env file üîê

The backend will fail, if wrong environments variables are provided. If no .env file is provided, please create `packages/backend/.env` with following content:

```bash
ADMIN_ID=00000...000
ADMIN_NAME=username#00000
DISCORD_CHANNEL=00000...000
DISCORD_TOKEN=XXXXXX....XXX
JWT_SECRET=ChooseTheSecretWisely
JWT_EXPIRESIN=1h
MONGO_HOST=mongodb://localhost:27017/fmdb
MONGOOSE_DEBUG=true
MOODLE_BASE_URL=https://moodle.example.com/
MOODLE_FETCH_INTERVAL=1000
MOODLE_REMINDER_TIME_LEFT=86400
MOODLE_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
MOODLE_USE_COURSE_SHORTNAME=true
MOODLE_USERID=00000
NODE_ENV=development
SERVER_PORT=4040
```

Attention: For coding use get functions first if defined!
Example: getDiscordChannel() and getRefreshRate() instead of
config constants discordChannel and fetchInterval.
