### Hey üëã

The Notification Service is a web application, that notifies you about various activities on your Moodle‚Ñ¢ Software. Notifications can be send to **all your favorite messaging channels ‚ù§Ô∏è like Matrix, Slack, MS Teams, etc.¬π**. The current implementation includes: 

- Notifications about new files
- Notifications about new assignments
- Notifications about assignments due soon

Version 2 of the Notification Service (formerly "Fancy Moodle Discord Bot") is still under active development and testing. If you want to setup our own service, please checkout the `main` branch and follow the instructions in [this wiki](https://docs.tjarbo.me/moodle-notification-service/1.0.0/home). Overall the entire project is still under active development. That means it is very likely that **new major versions will break the backwards compatibility.** So make sure to read the change log before you start an upgrade. 

But what is new in version 2? After a long time we have successfully re-implemented the connector service to make it as easy as possible to add new services like Matrix, MS Teams or Webhooks. Our goal was to remove Discord as a dependency for authentication and instead use the lasted state-of-the-art technologies. Now the Notification Service uses [WebAuthn](https://docs.tjarbo.me/moodle-notification-service/2.0.0/advanced-guides/what-is-passwordless). But before we can publish a new release, it's time to test, measuring performance and to update [the wiki](https://docs.tjarbo.me/moodle-notification-service/2.0.0/home)

To stay up to date and get notified as soon as a new release is available, click on *watch* in the upper right corner, then *custom* and activate *Releases* and *Discussions* ‚úÖ (so that your inbox does not get spammed üòâ)! And if you like the Notification Service, give it a üåü - thank you ü§©!

Cheers üçª!

¬π Currently only Discord is supported, more are coming soon. If we are to slow for you, make a PR üòâ

#### Prepare environment ü¶ï

Follow the steps described in [this wiki artice](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/wiki/Setup-your-own-bot): Setup a bot for developing, generate your moodle token and save your `.env` file at `./packages/backend/`.

### Start development üõ´

Run `npm run start` at the root of the directory.

Attention: For coding use get functions first if defined!
