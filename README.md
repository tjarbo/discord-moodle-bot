## üìÆ News from core team!
Hey üëã Almost a year ago, we made the first commit to this repo ü§Ø. While back then, the focus was mainly on getting any notification on Discord. Since than we have added many improvements and new features. But over time, our tools have changed as well. That's why we are in the process of becoming more independent from Discord with the upcoming versions, so you can be notified on **all your favorite channels ‚ù§Ô∏è like Matrix, Slack, MS Teams etc.** even if you do not have a Discord Account! 

With the next two (maybe three) versions, **we will make fundamental changes**, so the code will not be backward compatible. Do not forget to read the changelog if you start an upgrade üßê. More information [here](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/discussions/89)!

To stay up to date and get notified as soon as a new release is available, click on *watch* in the upper right corner, than *custom* and activate *Releases* and *Discussions* ‚úÖ (so that your inbox is not spammed üòâ)! And if you like the fmdb, give it a üåü - thank you ü§©!

Cheers üçª!

[![CD - Release](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/actions/workflows/cd.release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/actions/workflows/cd.release.yml)

The set-up is a somewhat more complex process. Therefore we have created a separate Wiki article for this purpose. You can find it [here](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/wiki/).

## ‚öíÔ∏è Development
[![CI](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites ‚öóÔ∏è
> We have also setup a `.devcontainer`.  [Learn more](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)

- Local MongoDB installation on port 27017 (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
- Node with NPM installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Discord Server to test the application

#### Installing modules üìÅ

Run `npm i` at the root of the repository and `npm run postinstall`

#### Prepare environment ü¶ï

Follow the steps described in [this wiki artice](https://github.com/tjarbo/discord-moodle-bot/wiki/Setup-your-own-bot): Setup a bot for developing, generate your moodle token and save your `.env` file at `./packages/backend/`.

### Start development üõ´

Run `npm run start` at the root of the directory.

Attention: For coding use get functions first if defined!
Example: getDiscordChannel() and getRefreshRate() instead of
config constants discordChannel and fetchInterval.
